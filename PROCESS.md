## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow & Development Tools

- **Sprint Planning:** Used to collaboratively define the sprint goal, assign stories based on capacity, and align on deliverables.
- **Backlog Grooming:** Conducted between sprints to reprioritize, clarify, or split large stories for improved planning.
- **Daily Collaboration:** Maintained through Discord with real-time updates, asynchronous discussions, and file sharing.
- **Code Management:** Branching strategy employed using Git + GitHub. All work initiated in feature branches, merged via pull requests to `main`, and deployed to `production` after review.
- **Deployment Pipeline:** Static deployment using **Azure Static Web Apps**; file storage and metadata managed using **Firebase**.
- **Documentation:** Tracked in `README.md`, `TEAM.md`, and relevant component documentation to ensure future developer clarity.

## ‚úÖ Issue Tracking & Task Assignment

- **Tooling:** GitHub Projects and Issues
- **Sprint Backlog:** Actively maintained to track work in progress and visualize team progress

## üîÑ Change Management

- **Branching Workflow:**
  - `main`: Acts as the integration branch where features are merged after peer review and basic testing.
  - `production`: Receives verified, stable builds intended for live deployment.
- **Merge Protocol:**

## üîç Continuous Improvement

We committed to regular reflection through retrospectives, improving on communication, sprint estimation, and documentation clarity each cycle. Our evolving adoption of TailwindCSS, i18n, and deployment strategies showcases our adaptive mindset and long-term thinking.
