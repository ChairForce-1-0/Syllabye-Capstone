## 🌍 Internationalization

Syllabye supports bilingual language switching powered by `react-i18next`. To learn how to modify, extend, or translate components, see:

- [`i18n-guide.md`](./src/i18n-guide.md)
- [`src/i18n.js`](./src/i18n.js)

The `LanguageToggle` component enables real-time switching between English and Spanish.

---

## 📄 Process & Documentation

- [`PROCESS.md`](./PROCESS.md): Agile workflow, sprint planning, and dev practices
- [`i18n-guide.md`](./src/i18n-guide.md): Language support and i18next usage

---

## 🔧 Developer Notes

- Use `npm run dev` to launch the development server.
- PDF upload and management is powered by Firebase.
- TailwindCSS is now the primary styling framework (replacing Bootstrap).
- Route configuration is managed in `staticwebapp.config.json` for Azure deployments.

---

## 🧠 For Future Contributors

We encourage future developers to:

- Expand language support (add new locales in `i18n.js`)
- Migrate remaining Bootstrap components to TailwindCSS
- Implement role-based dashboards and permission logic
- Strengthen accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Add automated testing and validation tools
